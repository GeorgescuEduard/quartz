While working at Ubisoft I have taken responsibility to coordinate the tests for a team of a few members on multiple platforms, such as PS4, PS5, Xbox, PC and Switch, and I have constantly learned how to setup and work with all of these platforms.  
  
On multiple projects that I was working on, I was well noticed for:  
- reporting a high variety of issues according to the standards of QC department
- fast learning of the QC concepts
- teaching QC procedures to the new team members
- creating test plans for multiple features using the available internal tools
- delivering multiple reports to the Production team
- coordinating the execution of the test runs and preparing reports for each run
- coordinating the regression of resolved issues for each new build
- coordinating the build deployment to team‚Äôs consoles and PCs
- developing and improving internal tools using JavaScript
- constantly seeking improvements
- always being up for new challenges  

During my 4 years of experience in Ubisoft, I managed to be part of the core team on multiple projects, and I was nominated and awarded with a certificate of excellence in recognition of great sense of responsibility.  
  
While working at Ubisoft in the QC department I was constantly collecting ideas, requests and thinking how some QC procedures could be improved and I began working on a few applications using JavaScript, Angular and ASP .NET Core that could speed up these QC procedures.
