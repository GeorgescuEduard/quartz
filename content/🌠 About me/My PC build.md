#about_me 

I am also a PC enthusiast and I like to talk about PC components and give my opinions on it. I try to remain updated with any new component release, their performance, and potential risks and problems that could be encountered.

I picked the parts for my PC in **late 2023** and built it myself, it turned out pretty good and I am satisfied with it's performance.

The entire build cost me around **7500 RON**, and here are the parts:

- CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 7700
- CPU Cooler: Deepcool AK620 120mm
- GPU: MSI GeForce RTX 4060Ti VENTUS 16GB
- RAM: ADATA XPG Lancer RGB 32GB 6000MHz CL30 DDR5 Dual Channel Kit
- Motherboard: GIGABYTE B650M D3HP
- PSU: Seasonic Focus GX-750 80+ Gold
- Storage: Samsung 980 Evo Pro 1TB
- Case: Deepcool CG540 Middle Tower
- Main Display: MSI Optix 27" IPS 1080p 144hz

The PC is working really good and I can play most of the newly released games at 144 FPS - 1080p - Medium to Ultra settings. If I am playing an single player game, then I would use high or ultra settings. But if I am playing a pvp competitive game I like to lower the graphics settings to medium so there are fewer effects on the screen that distract me.
##### Q&A
>  ðŸ”¥*Why the non-X CPU variant?*
>  Temperature and noise is something that I am constantly concerned about. Before this PC, I played games only on laptops while using silent mode because these are getting hot and loud really fast, and that annoyed me.
>  So, I got the non-X variant to have cooler temperatures and less noise. I don't want to perform any curve optimization using the BIOS because I don't wanted to risk getting BSOD errors or instability in the system.

> ðŸ–¥*Why are you still using 1080p displays, even with 27"? Aren't you seeing pixels?*
> No, I got familiar with this resolution, the only thing that matters to me is the refresh rate because my eyes start to hurt if I am playing a fast paced game on 60hz.
> I have 2 monitors like these but I am planning get one more that would help me in developing and testing games. I am thinking to get a 4K 27" IPS display, with this one I think I can test the resolution other games could play.

>[!DANGER] Stupid things that I did :)
> ðŸ•¹ When I ordered the PC components, I brought a Noctua cooler NH-D15 which has a dimension of 140mm, instead of 120mm of the current cooler. I check the RAM clearance and the space in the case, and it was a perfect fit, but I forgot to check the GPU clearance. Because I got an mATX motherboard, the cooler was pushing the GPU by ~2mm and it was directly a no go for me. So I returned the Noctua cooler and got the new one, and now I will always remember to check the GPU clearance when picking parts for a PC.

> ðŸ”¥ I helped a friend with solving his FPS problems on his PC, he needed an storage upgrade because he was using an old HDD. The only option was to get an SATA SSD because his motherboard doesn't have M2 slots.
> Now for the stupid thing, I asked him if he needed SATA cables for the new SSD, and I gave him SATA cables from my modular PSU. When he installed the SSD with my instruction and with my cables, the SSD died ðŸ˜¢
> Now I know that PSU cables are not universal.
