Welcome to my website created by using ![[obsidian-logo-gradient.png|15]][Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and 🌱[Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), and published with ![[vercel-logo.png|15]] [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

I am a 25-year-old ***Quality Control Tester***, armed with a Master's degree in Computer Science and Pedagogy and with over **4 years** of work experience in ensuring the utmost standards of software quality and performance.

With my passion for programming, web development and video games, I became operational in using ASP .NET Core, Angular and SQL Server for developing web applications and, in my free time, I am learning and developing video games in the Unreal Engine, using Blueprints and the C++ programming language.

> [!INFO] Currently seeking for new opportunities
> I am currently seeking a job in **Romania** or other countries that allow fully working remote.
> I have a great interest to continue working in **Quality Control / Assurance** positions and I am open to other various gaming, software and web development opportunities.
> 
> If you believe I can bring value to your team and would like to collaborate, please feel free to send me an email at [georgescu.ioneduard@gmail.com](mailto:georgescu.ioneduard@gmail.com).
