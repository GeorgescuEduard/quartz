Welcome to my website created by using ![[obsidian-logo-gradient.png|15]][Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and ðŸŒ±[Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), and published with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

I am a 25-year-old ***Quality Control Tester***, armed with a Master's degree in Computer Science and Pedagogy and with over **4 years** of work experience in ensuring the utmost standards of software quality and performance.

With my passion for programming, web development and video games, I became operational in using ASP .NET Core, Angular and SQL Server for developing web applications and, in my free time, I am learning and developing video games in the Unreal Engine, using Blueprints and the C++ programming language.
