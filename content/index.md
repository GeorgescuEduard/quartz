Welcome to my website created by using ![[obsidian-logo-gradient.png|15]][Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and ðŸŒ±[Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), and published with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

I am a 25-year-old ***Quality Control Tester***, armed with a Master's degree in Computer Science and Pedagogy and with over four years of work experience in ensuring the utmost standards of software quality and performance.

With my passion for programming, web development and video games, I became operational in using ASP .NET Core, Angular and SQL Server for developing web applications and, in my free time, I am learning and developing video games in the Unreal Engine, using Blueprints and the C++ programming language.
