Codename **DOLLS** is a third person shooter that is taking place in year ~2065 after a catastrophic event split the world in 2 main factions, the humanity and the corrupted.

You are playing as the puppets that are created by humans to fight for humanity with the ultimate goal to eliminate all the opposing factions and find a cure for the corruption.

The corruption has 2 similar effects depending on ==_what you are_==, if you are a human, the corruption will take over you and turn you into a zombie after a few days, if you are a doll, the corruption will corrode your metal body to find its way into your 'brain' and alter the memories, making you turn against the humans but with an heavy altered aspect of your old body.
