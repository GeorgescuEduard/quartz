> The following project is inspired by the [Zom 100](https://myanimelist.net/anime/54112/Zom_100__Zombie_ni_Naru_made_ni_Shitai_100_no_Koto "https://myanimelist.net/anime/54112/Zom_100__Zombie_ni_Naru_made_ni_Shitai_100_no_Koto") show, I recommend watching the first episode *(20min)* to catch the idea of the project.

Codename **SCAR** is a first person zombie survival game that is taking place in year ~2030, where you will play as a character that was exploited for work in the companies and finally has a chance to take a break from work.

You have worked yourself to the bone at you dream job and let company exploit you just to survive in this world and create a meaning in your life, hoping that someone will save you in the meantime from this work life.

Well, the save has finally arrived and over 99% of the world population are now zombies, upon realizing this, you are relieved that you donâ€™t have to go to work anymore. But you have to survive the apocalypse.

From now on, the game focuses on your survival in this apocalypse, the skills you have gained at your work might come in handy depending on your [[Professions]] and the game mechanics will be discovered by the player without tutorials.

> [!SUCCESS] Your final objective:
> Get out of this damned place and enjoy a vacation somewhere.
