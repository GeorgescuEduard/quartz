#the_game 
### Prologue
The game will begin after selecting your [[Professions]], showing you the character leaving the ==company building according of your profession== and going home late while cursing the company and this damn day.

In the morning you struggle to get out of bed and curse the company and the stupid work you have to do, only to be greeted by a zombie when you open the door outside. You manage to kill/escape the zombie, and while you are outside you notice a lot more of them.

You check the time on your phone only to realize that you are late for work. But the boss didnâ€™t contact you or gave you any warning this time.

> _Does that mean that I am finally free?_
