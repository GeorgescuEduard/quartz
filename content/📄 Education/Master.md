#education 

I continued my studies in the Computer Science domain at University of Craiova where I learned more about developing web applications using database systems and multiple techniques to process the information.  
To finalize the studies, I constantly worked to develop an application similar to Jira which can prove all of my gained knowledge through these years of study.
